  {
    "id": "signup",
    "question": "How do I sign up?",
    "answer": "Go to /signup, enter a valid email and a password (minimum 8 characters: include uppercase, lowercase, a number and a symbol). After signup the app sets an httpOnly JWT cookie for authentication — you won't see the token in the browser for security reasons."
  },
  {
    "id": "login",
    "question": "How do I log in?",
    "answer": "Go to /login and enter your registered email and password. On success the server sets a secure httpOnly cookie named 'token' to keep you logged in."
  },
  {
    "id": "logout",
    "question": "How do I log out?",
    "answer": "Click the logout button in the UI or call POST /api/auth/logout. That clears the auth cookie and ends your session."
  },
  {
    "id": "create-blog",
    "question": "How do I create a blog post?",
    "answer": "You must be logged in. From the Dashboard click New Post, enter a title and content, then publish. The backend automatically creates a URL-friendly slug from your title. Only the logged-in user is recorded as the author."
  },
  {
    "id": "edit-blog",
    "question": "Who can edit a blog?",
    "answer": "Only the original author (the user who created the blog) can edit it. The server checks your JWT and compares your user ID with the blog's author field before allowing edits."
  },
  {
    "id": "delete-blog",
    "question": "Who can delete a blog?",
    "answer": "Only the blog's author can delete it. Deletion is protected by authentication middleware and an author ID check on the blog resource."
  },
  {
    "id": "password-rules",
    "question": "What are the password rules?",
    "answer": "Passwords must be at least 8 characters and include uppercase, lowercase, a number, and a symbol. The server validates the rule and stores a bcrypt hash — raw passwords are never kept."
  },
  {
    "id": "public-access",
    "question": "Are blogs public?",
    "answer": "Yes — published blogs can be read by anyone using GET /api/blogs. Reading posts does not require authentication."
  },
  {
    "id": "auth-storage",
    "question": "How is authentication stored on the client?",
    "answer": "The app stores the session token in an httpOnly cookie named 'token' to reduce XSS risk. The token is not stored in localStorage."
  },
  {
    "id": "api-endpoints",
    "question": "What API endpoints are available?",
    "answer": "Key endpoints include: POST /api/auth/signup, POST /api/auth/login, POST /api/auth/logout, POST /api/blog (create, auth required), GET /api/blogs, GET /api/blogs/:slug, PUT /api/blogs/edit/:id (author only), DELETE /api/blogs/delete/:id (author only), POST /api/ai/query (support bot)."
  },
  {
    "id": "slug-generation",
    "question": "How are URLs/slugs generated?",
    "answer": "Slugs are generated by slugifying the title. If a slug already exists, the backend appends -1, -2, etc., to keep URLs unique."
  },
  {
    "id": "data-storage",
    "question": "Where is data stored?",
    "answer": "This project uses MongoDB via Mongoose. Users and blogs are saved to collections; passwords are hashed before saving."
  },
  {
    "id": "agent-scope",
    "question": "What can the support agent answer?",
    "answer": "The agent answers questions contained in this KB (platform usage, API endpoints, auth rules, and UX). If the KB doesn't include the answer, it will say it doesn't know and point you to the project's contact or issue tracker."
  },
  {
    "id": "report-bug",
    "question": "How do I report a bug or request a feature?",
    "answer": "Open an issue in the project repo or send a message via the app's Contact link. For demos, add a 'Contact' section to the README with instructions."
  },

  {
    "id": "forgot-password",
    "question": "I forgot my password — what do I do?",
    "answer": "Use the 'Forgot password' link on the login page. You'll receive an email with a secure link to reset your password. If you don't get an email, check your spam folder or contact support."
  },
  {
    "id": "change-email",
    "question": "Can I change my account email?",
    "answer": "Yes — go to your account settings and update your email. You'll usually need to confirm the new email via a link sent to that address."
  },
  {
    "id": "add-images",
    "question": "How do I add images to a blog post?",
    "answer": "In the editor use the image upload button (or paste an image). The file is uploaded to the server and the editor inserts it into your post. Keep image sizes reasonable for faster loading."
  },
  {
    "id": "drafts",
    "question": "What is a draft and how do I use it?",
    "answer": "A draft is an unpublished post you can save while working. From Drafts you can continue editing later and publish when ready. Drafts are private to your account."
  },
  {
    "id": "scheduling",
    "question": "Can I schedule a post to publish later?",
    "answer": "If scheduling is supported in the UI, set a publish date/time when creating the post. If there is no scheduling option, publish manually when you're ready."
  },
  {
    "id": "who-sees-my-post",
    "question": "Who can see my published post?",
    "answer": "Published posts are public and accessible to anyone with the post URL or via the public blog listing."
  },
  {
    "id": "collaboration",
    "question": "Can someone else edit my post?",
    "answer": "By default no — only the post author can edit. If collaboration features exist they will be described in the app settings or docs."
  },
  {
    "id": "abuse-report",
    "question": "How do I report abusive or inappropriate content?",
    "answer": "Use the app's Report or Contact link and include the post URL and a short description. The team will review and take action per the platform's policy."
  },
  {
    "id": "privacy",
    "question": "Is my personal data private?",
    "answer": "The platform stores only necessary account info (email, hashed password). Personal data handling follows the project's privacy policy — check the README or privacy page for details."
  },
  {
    "id": "support-response-time",
    "question": "How long does support take to respond?",
    "answer": "Response time depends on the project's support policy. For demos, ask users to open an issue in the repo or use the Contact link for the fastest response."
